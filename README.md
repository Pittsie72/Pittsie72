I'm a Cybersecurity Analyst who obtained thier bachelors from Chestnut Hill College in 3 years rather than the traditional 4. 
Upon starting my job my boss told me I should start to learn Python as it's useful for almost anything. Fast forward a few years and I can say he was absolutely right!
I switch from mainly using Java in college to now almost soley using Python. I've started to dip my toes in rust as well as go lang
